# Personality Quiz App

This is a basic Flutter app that I made as I learned how to utilise containers, cards, divide apps into many widgets, and other Flutter fundamentals. You respond to questions in this app about your favourite colour, animal, etc., and in the end you are given a statement that describes your personality based on your score. You may even reset the quiz in the app to do it again. Peace âœŒ
